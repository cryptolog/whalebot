Wondering what is going on with that "WhaleBot" or should I say Fronema bot and 100s of posts long thread? keep reading.

Let's compare a bot that CanadaBitcoin promotes so meticulously and actively (that his thread has been number one on CT since like 3 days) to the original one written by Fronema:

(sound of drums) http://www.diffchecker.com/hmb4p89x

(original code: https://cryptotrader.org/backtests/QEDsk48cP524XYNiG)

Can you spot the difference? Yes, the guy has the guts to accept donations for removing original contributions header and changing 3 numbers in the code.

So what is he really doing? I suspect it is all about SEO, promoting his GHS "business", that is why github link with his homepage that links to cexio.ca and sure enough another link to his whaleghs.ca (both registered with GoDaddy in January) - vanseo.ca/client/whale2/ vanseo does the "SEO" :-)

What is going to happen next? It is not about a whalebot/tunning whalebot/another contest or whatever he comes up with, it is about having his thread and links on top of CT, so he is going to post there nonsense just to bump it, please be smarter than that and simply do not take part in this whole circus.

And Hey you could tweak original Fronema's bot if you believe you can make it profitable (I do not) and give credits to the guy who made it (not the guy who renamed it).

Happy coding!

Liteguy, can you post a link to your trader instance?

@CanadaBitcoin, I'd be willing to try it if you would send me 0.01BTC. I'd give you 0.02BTC back if it turns a profit.

Trader59 2 days ago
If you're so confident your bot will work, then I'm sure you'd be willing to pony up a measly 0.01BTC for the sake of your reputation.

Trader59 2 days ago
Or I'll take the same deal as Liteguy

Notice how your bot isn't profitable? It's because alex made all limit orders execute at market. Check your bot. It's not very profitable.

How am I the troll? YOUR BOT DOESNT WORK.

Trader59 2 days ago
You're misleading people and that's wrong.

@wild0wnes it's worse than Fronema's bot!

Trader59 2 days ago
@Canada now THAT'S what I like to see :) Good job!

Trader59 2 days ago
Actually nvm it doesn't work long-term lol.

Trader59 a day ago
No, it loads that info immediately. At launch, it loads something like 250 ticks.

A bot doesn't get better over time. It doesn't "mature."

@wild0wnes, how much have you lost/gain so far?

Trader59 about 21 hours ago

hes investing .5 btc when he hasnt paused the bot

wild0wnes a day ago
@Trader59 im not using this bot. I wouldnt touch it from the beginning. it think you may be reading my messages wrong. This guy is a clown. Ive only posted links to his own bot code to show how bad its actually doing.

wild0wnes a day ago
i don't know the code that he's using but slope sounds great.... but "pudding" he has none.... but at least he will have some by monday ;-)

wild0wnes a day ago
prediction.... bot will be paused when it shows to not win as often as he predicts. or deposits will be made to make the account look like a win.... or he'll change his top post to another bot and say my post wasn't really linking to his or CT had an issue or whatever and had to restart..... this guy is a riot. looking forward to checking this monday

wild0wnes a day ago
oh cool. sounds like liteguy has it covered. Carry on men

@CanadaBitcoin Thank you for removing "Proof of profitability" and all that pudding talk from the OP and Title. I wish you the best. I'm all for open sourcing code but the false promises were outrageous. Slope is a fun idea to play with ... although it feels super risky to think it could consistently do well in something so low volume... but experimenting is how you find out so good luck everyone. I'm through here.

hey CanadaBitcoin.... what's cexio.ca? I don't want to assume its a scam so i thought I'd just ask you

wild0wnes 21 minutes ago
but why does cexio.ca forward to cex.io?

That usually makes me think something is fishy....
makes me wonder if cexio is a phishing site? or Scam perhaps?

I don't know how canadian URLS work so perhaps thats the only way for people to get to cex.io?
