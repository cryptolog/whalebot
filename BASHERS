Liteguy, can you post a link to your trader instance?

@CanadaBitcoin, I'd be willing to try it if you would send me 0.01BTC. I'd give you 0.02BTC back if it turns a profit.

Trader59 2 days ago
If you're so confident your bot will work, then I'm sure you'd be willing to pony up a measly 0.01BTC for the sake of your reputation.

Or I'll take the same deal as Liteguy

Notice how your bot isn't profitable? It's because alex made all limit orders execute at market. Check your bot. It's not very profitable.

How am I the troll? YOUR BOT DOESNT WORK.

Trader59 2 days ago
You're misleading people and that's wrong.

@wild0wnes it's worse than Fronema's bot!

@Canada now THAT'S what I like to see :) Good job!

Actually nvm it doesn't work long-term lol.

No, it loads that info immediately. At launch, it loads something like 250 ticks.

A bot doesn't get better over time. It doesn't "mature."

@wild0wnes, how much have you lost/gain so far?

Trader59 about 21 hours ago

Trader59 about 20 hours ago
You're profiting off of people running this bot.

hes investing .5 btc when he hasnt paused the bot

@Trader59 im not using this bot. I wouldnt touch it from the beginning. it think you may be reading my messages wrong. This guy is a clown. Ive only posted links to his own bot code to show how bad its actually doing.

wild0wnes a day ago
i don't know the code that he's using but slope sounds great.... but "pudding" he has none.... but at least he will have some by monday ;-)

wild0wnes a day ago
prediction.... bot will be paused when it shows to not win as often as he predicts. or deposits will be made to make the account look like a win.... or he'll change his top post to another bot and say my post wasn't really linking to his or CT had an issue or whatever and had to restart..... this guy is a riot. looking forward to checking this monday

wild0wnes a day ago

@CanadaBitcoin Thank you for removing "Proof of profitability" and all that pudding talk from the OP and Title. I wish you the best. I'm all for open sourcing code but the false promises were outrageous. Slope is a fun idea to play with ... although it feels super risky to think it could consistently do well in something so low volume... but experimenting is how you find out so good luck everyone. I'm through here.

hey CanadaBitcoin.... what's cexio.ca? I don't want to assume its a scam so i thought I'd just ask you

wild0wnes 21 minutes ago
but why does cexio.ca forward to cex.io?

That usually makes me think something is fishy....
makes me wonder if cexio is a phishing site? or Scam perhaps?

I don't know how canadian URLS work so perhaps thats the only way for people to get to cex.io?
