@CanadaBitcoin

Who is bashing now? When you were being flamed by almost the entire community I didn't see anyone else step up and try to support you? What I saw enough pressure that the admin for the website delete your topic and you needed someone to stand up with you.

I followed the exact model dates and times you suggested, no change or deviation, I put money in a wallet to show good faith that I was ready to pay when there was profit. When the bot closed I put a straight forward report out not saying anything that wasn't proven by active logs, that everyone saw. No negative comment made about your skill or your person was ever made.

I am not sure if you think I am guy with money to blow on the next wild idea, I had to pull money out of another exchange to help support you. Forget the price of opportunity on the other exchange. The way I saw it I was the only guy on the board who has a reputation of helping people, support you. You make negative comments about me, "kind of a basher". You question my intent, if I was trying to scam you?

This is the funniest way to say thank you to someone who when just about everyone else is discouraging you someone steps up and tries to support you.

I am having trouble wanting to continue to help. Money is business, how you treat someone is personal. Help me understand why on a personal level I would want to help?

I was going to let it go, but after reading your comments you may want to reread what I purposed the test parameters were and to the point the payouts.

You guys understand that CanadaBitcoin do not know anything he claims to know?

He just used the other bot and played around with the settings - thats what these default bots are done for.

He is the standard seo troll, if you know one you know all.

I don't care much what he is doing but for the inexperienced people here this is just the first and most important lesson: Learn who is trustable and who is not. This all here is about money, some have alot money here.

Everywhere where money is involved people like CanadaBitcoin pops up and the way they act is pretty much like CanadaBitcoin behaves here - This kind of claiming to know things, denying every argument which is against it and so on.

STFU kid. You know nothing of open source. First of all KID you don't steal shit someone else spent hours or days on. Only change a FUCKING variable and claim it is your work.

I can pipe up because I know what I'm talking about. You don't as your a fucking thief. You haven't rebutted shit and resort to childish behavior of adding people who call you out on your pathetic word game to some bullshit "bashers list".

Grow up KID.

I just looked at your live trading bots... Both started out with tiny gains and are now making losses since you've publicized them. You think it's just a coincidence?

Look at all those canceled orders in your logs man. Insane slippage. Why are you cramming your bot down peoples throats? Unless your manually trading off the buy and sell walls that your bot is creating like I am.

Wondering what is going on with that "WhaleBot" or should I say Fronema bot and 100s of posts long thread? keep reading.

Let's compare a bot that CanadaBitcoin promotes so meticulously and actively (that his thread has been number one on CT since like 3 days) to the original one written by Fronema:

(sound of drums) http://www.diffchecker.com/hmb4p89x

(original code: https://cryptotrader.org/backtests/QEDsk48cP524XYNiG)

Can you spot the difference? Yes, the guy has the guts to accept donations for removing original contributions header and changing 3 numbers in the code.

So what is he really doing? I suspect it is all about SEO, promoting his GHS "business", that is why github link with his homepage that links to cexio.ca and sure enough another link to his whaleghs.ca (both registered with GoDaddy in January) - vanseo.ca/client/whale2/ vanseo does the "SEO" :-)

What is going to happen next? It is not about a whalebot/tunning whalebot/another contest or whatever he comes up with, it is about having his thread and links on top of CT, so he is going to post there nonsense just to bump it, please be smarter than that and simply do not take part in this whole circus.

And Hey you could tweak original Fronema's bot if you believe you can make it profitable (I do not) and give credits to the guy who made it (not the guy who renamed it).

Happy coding!

No if he's giving credit to the original author thats fair enough. And more than fair if he's leaving the original guy's donation address.

I'm hanging up my bashing hat. I was irked by the claims of the bot being a sure winner without proof and you removed those claims. I agree there is no need to take this any farther.

Liteguy, can you post a link to your trader instance?

@CanadaBitcoin, I'd be willing to try it if you would send me 0.01BTC. I'd give you 0.02BTC back if it turns a profit.

Trader59 2 days ago
If you're so confident your bot will work, then I'm sure you'd be willing to pony up a measly 0.01BTC for the sake of your reputation.

Or I'll take the same deal as Liteguy

Notice how your bot isn't profitable? It's because alex made all limit orders execute at market. Check your bot. It's not very profitable.

How am I the troll? YOUR BOT DOESNT WORK.

You're misleading people and that's wrong.

@wild0wnes it's worse than Fronema's bot!

@Canada now THAT'S what I like to see :) Good job!

Actually nvm it doesn't work long-term lol.

No, it loads that info immediately. At launch, it loads something like 250 ticks.

A bot doesn't get better over time. It doesn't "mature."
